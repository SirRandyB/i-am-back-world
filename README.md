This repo is a reintroduction for practicing the Github Flow.

In the past I have used Github, but it has been a really long time. I have made a bad habit of creating projects locally and never pushing anything.

The goal is to create consistency in my workflow that will align with my goals in becoming a great programmer. 

A little about me.
For starters my name is Randy and I have worked in the IT field for about 3 years. About six months ago I was laid off due to the loss of contracts/work. In the meantime I have applied to various roles, but to no avail. I am currently working as a machine operator for a window factory. 

To some this may be an unfortunate situation, but as I look around I am not alone in this. I look at this as a opportunity to refresh and gain new skills and come back even stronger than before. 

Stay tuned to the next episode.
